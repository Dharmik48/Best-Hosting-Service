## How to choose a hosting service for your website?

- There are a lot of FREE and PAID hosting services out there, sometimes it gets a little hard choosing which one is right for you, so in this blog, I will let you know which one is good for you and the benefits.

## What I use
I personally use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) most of the time, but I use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) sometimes.


## What You Should Use 
- FREE:
  - If you just want to deploy your HTML, CSS, JS to a website, I highly suggest using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)...

  - If you want to Deploy Flask, or something of that sort, you can use [Heroku](herokuapp.com) and I also believe you can use [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

- PAID:
   - If you want to go to the paid option, there are many out there.. I haven't really gotten into PAID hosting, so you can [check this article out](https://www.quicksprout.com/best-web-hosting/)
